// Create a function that takes a string as an arguement.
// The function must return a string containing 1s and 0s based on the string arguement’s words.
// if any word in the arguement is not equal to “zero” or “one” (case insensitive), you should ignore it.
// The returned string’s length should be a multiple of 8, if the string is not a multiple of 8, you should remove the numbers in excess.
